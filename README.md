My first git depository.

Don't know why I took so long to get to git. Guess I was really, I mean really into suffering.

You have to do this a thousand times before you begin to understand it. Doing it is the thing. So, hence, I'll be branching and pulling and merging a few times. Maybe a thousand times. What time is it now?
