# hello-world
My first git suppository.

Don't know why I took so long to get to git. Guess I was really, I mean REALLY, into suffering.

You have to do this a thousand times before you begin to understand it. Doing it is the thing. So, hence, I'll be branching and pulling and merging a few times. Maybe a thousand times, who knows. What time is it now? I think it's coffee time.

So, I've returned and promptly forgotten everything I did 2 weeks ago or so.
