# hello-world
My first git suppository.

Don't know why I took so long to get to git. Guess I was really, I mean REALLY, into suffering.

You have to do this a thousand times before you begin to understand it. Doing it is the thing. So, hence, I'll be branching and pulling and merging a few times. Maybe a thousand times, who knows. What time is it now? I think it's coffee time.

So, I've returned and promptly forgotten everything I did 2 weeks ago or so.

Did I say 2 weeks, I meant 2 months, and yes I've forgotten everything. That's what happens when you spend two months trolling the DOM and Javascript or, um, with Javascript. Print design was so much easier than this.

I've had to update a Security Token and pushed a slightly altered HTML file. It worked. That was almost 10 months between my last push, er, update.

So, if I were working on a project and I needed someone to help with the css file in this repo, they would be able to pull or clone it from here, work on it and then push it back up. Ok.
